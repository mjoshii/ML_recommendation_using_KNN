# Recommendation Using KNN (Nearest Neighbor) Method.

The code creates item based and user based recommendations for movies based on userIDs and movie ratings for a given sample. 
The process can be replicated for recommendation of any other product or service, if data is available.

The code has been commented for ease of use and also shared a brief background on different types of recommendation methods.

Changing KNN algorithms impacts the results and will change the output recommendation.
